# Architectural Decision Log

This project uses [Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)](https://adr.github.io/) to document important architectural decisions. This approach is inspired by practices like those in the [Emblem Given Project](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/emblem).

ADRs provide context, outline trade-offs, and explain the reasoning behind key technical choices. The goal is to preserve the understanding of how the project evolves and to capture insights that allow for effective revisiting of previous decisions.

To create a new decision record, use the provided template:

```sh
cp template.md YYYY-MM-DD-title-with-dashes.md
```
(Please use `YYYY-MM-DD` format for the date in the filename.)
